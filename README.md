# audio-api-oogabooga

## Summary
An voice interface for use with Oogabooga's text-generation-webui.

## Requirements
> python3

> sounddevice

> pyttsx3

> vosk

## Details
The interface is under development but works. It currently supports windows with ubuntu next on the list.

## Usage
It currently must be loaded seperately from text-generation-webui. Use the command line to open it with python3.

You currently have to go into the web interface for text-generation-webui and load a model before it will work.

## Installation

Install the requirements by running windows-requirements.txt.

Place everything from the windows folder into a new folder under the text-generation-webui-main directory, name it whatever as long as it doesn't conflict with any other folder names.

run Start.bat

If two terminals open up then it works. Enjoy speaking to your new "assistant".
